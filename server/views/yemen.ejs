         <h3> Explain Me Please I'm the Average Joe</h3>

         <p> The 2011 Arab Spring is viewed by most as the most effective movement of the people of the Middle East to make the Arab government more accountable to its citizens and listen to them more. </p>

         <p> The Arab Spring also came to Yemen. Yemeni citizens took to streets calling for the end of the rule of the President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The Yemeni people saw their country being pushed towards the brink of economic collapse and civil war </p>

         <p> President Ali Abdullah Saleh decided to respond with economic concessions, but he refused to resign. Soon, tensions got even worse, especially in the capital of Sanaa, where protestors were dying at the hands of the military. This escalated into deadly clashes between government forces and protestors </p>

         <p> Finally, Yemen saw a transfer of power in November to Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who was the Vice President. Hadi tried however failed to deal with many problems facing Yemen such as attacks by Al-Qaeda, disloyalty to him, a separatist movement in the South, as well as corruption, umeployment and food insecurity which was inherited from President Saleh. </p>

         <p> The Houth movement, a predominantly Shia led movement, took advantage of the new President's inaction and took control of their heartland of the Saada province </p>

         <p> Angry with the dillusion of the President, many average Yemenis, even non Shia's, supported the Houthis. </p>

         <p> In September 2014, the Houthi's layed siege to the capital. In January 2017, the Houthis surrounded the presidential palace and effectivility placed the President and his ministers under house arrest. They also gradually began to seize the government institutions by the beginning of 2015. President Hadi fleeing his palace to the city of Aden and abandoned his post, creating a vacuum for the Houthis, ISIS, and Al-Qaeda to establish more rule in the territory. </p>

         <p> The Houthi's countinued their rule, attempting to take control of the entire country, forcing President Hadi to flee abroad in March 2015 </p>

         <p> Saudi Arabia was alarmed by the rise of the Houthis, backed by their rivals Iran. They along with 8 other primarily Sunni Arab countries initiated a military campaign to restore President hadi back to power. </p>

         <h5> Currently </h5>

         <p> As of right now, no side is close to a military victory nor have peace talks been succesful. The Hadi government, backed by the Saudi-led coalition has established a home in Aden and taken back most of East Yemen </p>

         <p> However, the air campaign and the naval blockade by the Saudi-led coalition had failed to get rid of the Houthi rebels from their strongolds of Sanaa and its surrounding province. </p>

         <p> Jihadi groups such as AQAP (Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) and ISIS have stepped up their efforts to gain power in Yemen </p>

         <h5> Casualties </h5>

         <p> Unfortunetly, civilains have suffered the most during this fighting and have been victims of war crimes by activists and other countries. According to the UN, approximately 8010 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2015. Most of the people who have been killed are civilians. </p>

         <p> The destruction and bombings of infastructure, hospitals, schools and restrictions on food and fuel importants have pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. Some 17 million people are considered food insecure and 6.8 million severely food insecure. </p>

         <p> If the Yemeni people didn‚Äôt have it hard enough, WHO has recently announced that there appears to be a cholera outbreak in Yemen. An estimated 26 000 people have been infected since the outbreak back in October. Little can be done to help the country as it‚Äôs health facilities have been torn apart by the war. WHO states that less than 45% of their health facilities are still functioning. </p>

A civil war had been predicted long before the uprisings against incumbent regimes erupted elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa. Fears that Yemen might become ‚Äòthe next Somalia‚Äô or ‚Äòthe next Afghanistan‚Äô had been mounting for years, as had been the possibility that the Yemeni state might fragment into a series of autonomous, rival geographic segments where local identity groups were strong enough ‚Äì and well-armed enough ‚Äì to sustain themselves.

              <h3> Explain Me Please I'm a 5 Year Old </h3>
                 <p>Religion in Yemen is split roughly 60-40 between Sunni Muslims (~56%) and a branch of Shia Muslims called Zaidis (~42%). The Constitution of Yemen makes no provision for freedom of religion, and as result the Zaidis have felt oppressed and targeted by the Sunni majority government for a while. Tensions between a Zaidi rebel group called the Houthis (officially Ansar Allah) and the government have been growing since the 1990s until an off-an-on war broke out in 2004. The war has since escalated, and the Houthis took control of the Yemeni capital Sana'a in 2015, forcing the president, Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, to flee the country. </p>

                 <p>Yemen is now divided into roughly three parts: the west, controlled by the Houthi rebels, the south and east, controlled by the government still loyal to president Hadi, and the center, controlled by various militant groups including Ansar al-Sharia, al-Qaeda, and ISIS. </p>

                 <p> Kind of like the Korean War was first and foremost a war between North Korea and South Korea, but secondarily a proxy war between the capitalist USA and the communist USSR, the Yemeni Civil War is first and foremost a war between Houthis and Hadi loyalists, but secondarily a proxy war between the mostly-Shia Iran and the 100% Sunni Saudi Arabia. These two states have been bitter rivals pretty much since the current Islamic Republic of Iran came into existence. There a number of reasons why they're hostile to each other, like stance towards the USA (Saudi Arabia is our friend, Iran hates us), oil export competition, and especially a difference in religious majority, which is exacerbated by an extremist approach on both sides. Diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have been getting worse and worse and worse, and this is just one more arena where they can try to assert their dominance over the other. Where the sides are drawn is very clear: Iran, being mostly Shia, supports the Zaidi Shia rebels. Saudi Arabia, being Sunni, supports the Sunni Hadi-lead government. </p>

                <h3> Explain Me Please I am an American. </h3>

                <p> As an American you may think that the Yemen Civil War has zero to none impact on your real life. However, you maybe surprised. Maybe even horrified </p>

                <p> There are 2 main sides to the Yemen Civil War: the Houthi rebels and the supporters of President Hadi's government. The Houthi rebels are a Shia militant group which have became an enemy of Saudi Arabia and other Sunni majority countries in the Middle East. Arabian countries have forced a Saudi led coalition against the Houthi's and their uprisings. The Houthi's are uprising because they feel they have been discriminated against and oppresed by the government. They are now fighting back. However, Saudi Arabia disagrees. They believe that the Houthi's are being supported and funded by Iran and this is actually a proxy war for the dominance in the Middle East between Saudi Arabia and Iran. </p>

                <p> Now while Saudi Arabia is doing the bombing and fighting, the United States are backing and supporting the Sauds with weapons and financial means. Saudi Arabia is currently the largest buyed of US weaponry. Just recently, the US sold F-15 fighter jets and cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia. The Sauds are currently using those in the war against the Houthi's. </p>

                <p> The US even helps refuel Saudi jets, so that they can be more effective at bombing Yemen. They do this by using jets that are used for refueling fighter jets while still in the air. The US use them to refuel the Saudi F-15s in mid air so that they don't need to land and refuel. </p>

                <p> As one can clearly see, the US has a huge role in the Yemen Civil War. The bombings carried out by the Saudi Arabian military destroyed schools, universities, markets and worst of all, the seaport of al-Hudaydah, a port Yemen relies on to import a lot of their food. The US has began to speak out against these atrocities and even condemn some of them. They have asked the Saudi's to attempt to minimize these casualties. However, according to the latest reports this warning has done nothing. </p>

                <p> One may ask why the US allows the Saudis to continue commiting these atrocities and why they are so complicit to it. Well they are many reasons. One reason is that there has been a longstanding relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia, dating back to the Cold War. Another factor is the fear that Yamen may become a breeding zone and safe haven for terrorist organizations. AQAP (Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) currently controls swaths of land in Yemen and it is Al Qaeda most vicious and active branch. The US does not want to give terrorist organizations the means to plot more attacks against the West. </p>

                <p> I am not going to tell you what to or not to believe in. But let me just state the obvious. The US is currently helping Saudi Arabia and its allies fight a bloody war with massive casulaties and damage which shows no signs of ending. That is not something to be proud of </p>
