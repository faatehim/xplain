         <h3> Explain Me Please I'm The Average Joe</h3>


         <p> Artificial Intelligence will most likely impact and shape our future more than any other technology. Anybody who turns away from this technology will in a few years be a dinosaur and outdated according to Mark Cuban. The past few years have had an astonishing amount of advancements in AI. </p>

         <p> In 2017, AlphaGo beat the worlds best human players at Go-- a ancient chinese war strategy game. You may be thinking, what is the big deal? Didn't the chess playing computer Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997? Well Go is a game with more than 300 times the number of plays as Chess. After the first two moves of a chess game, there are 400 possible next moves. In Go, there are close to 130,000. Go is much more complicated and sophisticated than Chess. </p>

         <p> Also in 2017, OpenAI beat the world's top professionals in 1v1 matches of the online multiplayed game known as Dota 2 </p>


        <p> However Artificial intelligence is being used for more than just becoming masters at board and video games. Much of people's day to day technology is powered by artificial intelligence. You can point your phone's camera at the menu during your trip to India and the menu will be translated to English via Google Translate. </p>

        <p> Artificial Intelligence is being used to make our lives easier, more productive, and longer.  It will not be uncommon to see machines performing roles occupied by humans such as cab drivers, delivery man, etc. Who knows, maybe one day human doctors will become irrelevant! </p>

        <h5> Meaning of Artifical Intelligence </h5>

        <p> Artificial intelligence is the study of intelligent agents. Intelligent agents are devices that perceive the world around them, form a plan based on their perception, and make decisions to achieve x goals. Artificial Intelligence's are developed using mathematics, economics, game theory, philosophy, probability, linguistics, neuroscience, medicine, and much more. Some fields that fall under the umbrella of AI are  computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, robotics, etc. </p>

        <p> Machine Learning falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. Machine learning essentially allows for a machine to learn patterns between certain items without any of it having to be hard-coded or specified. To put it simply, machine learning attempts to make computers as smart as our brains.</p>

        <h5> Studying AI </h5>

        <p> There are 2 kinds of AI. The first type is artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) in which a computer can do whatever a human can do, except within narrow bounds. Some examples are the ones we have already discussed. </p>

        <p> Researchers are currently continuing to make strides towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is defined as an artificial general intelligence that can perform anything a human can. AGI is a huge deal. Once we created an AI which can improve itself and learn from its mistake's and past experiences, it will result in the opening of a pandora's box. AGI's will unlock a cycle of self improvement which would lead to an intelligence explosion. </p>

        <p> An AGI is also sometimes called the singularity. The term is borrowed from the gravitational singularity that occurs at the center of a black hole, an infinitely dense one-dimensional point where the laws of physics as we understand them start to break down. Just like there is zero visibility into what happens beyond the event horizon of a black hole, once AI can improve itself exponentially, it is almost impossible to predict what will happen? </p>

        <p> Ray Kurzweil, a inventor and futurist, predicts the singularity will occur by 2045. </p>

        <p> The development of a artificial intelligence greater with capabilites greater than humans have (ASI) could be amazing or terrible for us human species. Whether it is good or bad is all reliant on the what AIs will want in a way that is friendly to humans. </p>

        <p> Artificial Intelligence and its subfields will steam roll anything in its way and will have a massive impact on our day-to-day lives. </p>

                 <p> Us humans are very smart and complex. We can use our senses such as touch, smell, sight, hearing, and taste to help us gather information. Imagine you are in your room doing your homework. You suddenly hear a alarm ringing in your house. You can also smell smoke. What can you infer from those 2 clues. That there is a fire nearby right? Well computers are not as smart as you are. Most of the time they can only do what they have been told to do. AI is when you make a computer or software like a human brain. You help it to learn by giving it a lot of words and pictures and numbers to train it. If the computer hears you answer a lot of questions, later on it can quickly answer your questions.  </p>
