## Why should you use it?

Everything you need to create a basic project is included, all in a **4kb** file. On top of that, almost everything is styled automatically, without the need for learning specific classes. This allows for an intuitive experience developing with Wing, as it's designed to be a boilerplate stylesheet for any project.

## Installation

**npm**

```sh
$ npm install --save wingcss
```

**Link to It**

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/wingcss"/>
```
