## About

Not all humans are intellectually, mentally and physically the same. Your learning and understanding depends a lot on your age,
education, experience, and many more factors. However, most of the information out on the internet today is the same for all audiences.
No wonder this causes a lot of frustration for folks like me.

I am currently a ninth grader. When I got interested in Bitcoin and blockchain technology last year, the journey for knowledge was not easy.
Most of the material out there about Bitcoin is written from the writer’s perspective but not from the reader’s level.
Many Bitcoin explanatory articles are filled with technological jargon and difficult vocab words.

Soon I realized that this is a general problem for many topics. Try to make sense of any complex topic,
such as CRISPR from Wikipedia. It is incredibly confusing unless you are an advanced learner or an expert.
But if you are an expert or advanced learner, chance are you are not going to need those pages. Is it not a conundrum?

Explain Me Please is an attempt to solve a big problem: making curated, interactive content targeted for the reader
- a reader who could be a curious elementary or middle schooler, a auditory learner, a visual learner, a five-year-old,
or a nerd who wants content delivered to his taste in text, audio and video format.

## The Plan

I want to make Explain Me Please a new and improved Wikipedia. I plan to keep adding topics from all walks of life at a regular
rate. 


## Current Topics

- [Bitcoin](http://explainmeplease.com/resources?q=Bitcoin)
- [Ethereum](http://explainmeplease.com/resources?q=Ethereum)
- [CRISPR](http://explainmeplease.com/resources?q=CRISPR)
- [Artificial Intelligence](http://explainmeplease.com/resources?q=AI)
- [Yemen Civil War](http://explainmeplease.com/resources?q=Yemen)

## Future

- Complex Math Topics
- Current International Events
- Financial Concepts
- Other topics

## Contribute 

Explain Me Please (for now) is open source. We love contributers! Do you have any knowledge or experience in a particular subject or area?
Share your knowledge! 

One thing to remember is to write from the audience's perspective rather than your abilities. Let say you want to write about Quantum Computing.
You should have numerous categories such as 7 year old, Nerd, Average Joe, Mathematician, etc.

If it is useful, it will be on the site, credit given to you of course!

- fork & star the repo
- in the contribute folder, place your project files (source) & the tutorial text in a '.md' file

If you do not want to go through github, you can email me your content at feedback@explainmeplease.com
